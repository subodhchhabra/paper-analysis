### Paper Analysis

Analysis and implementation (in tensorflow) of deep learning papers. 

These papers are analyzed and summarized with emphasis on core machine learning and deep learning concepts that were used. 

We seek to explain the tougher ideas in these papers by building up to them from well-understood machine learning concepts. 

Our goal is to both understand these papers better, learn tensorflow, and show that deep learning research can be understood through understanding some core concepts.
